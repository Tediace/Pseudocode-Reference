# Pseudocode-Reference
<br>Pseudocode does not have a strict syntax but there are common ways of explaining different coding 
concepts like input, variables, conditional statements, loops and functions.</br>
##Input
<br>Input could be from a keyboard, database, mouse, and so on. You want to indicate that data is 
coming into the program from some external source.</br>
``get name from user``
```get user_record from employee_database```
#Variables
##Simple variable
Create a variable named points and give it the value of two:
```set points to 2```
